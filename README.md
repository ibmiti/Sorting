# Sorting

S: As datasets get larger sorting, become alot more expensive, so custom sorting algs become neccessary 
         

Q: what is sorting? :      
A:  
      
Q: What is Bubble Sort? :      
A:  
        
Q: What is Insertion Sort :    
A:  
      
         
Q:  what is Merge Sort?  :     
A:     
      
Q:   :      
A:    
         
Q: What is O(n log n) as seen with Merge sort : 
A:     
        
Q: what is a stable vs unstable algorithm :   
A:  
      
         
   ::::::::::::::::::: selection sorting :::::::::::::::::::::::      


Q: What is the goal of selection sorting?  :     
          
A:     Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.  
       it is an in-place comparison-based algorithm     
       the sorted portion of the array will find itself at the right end as the sorting continues.

Q: how does the sorting take place? :      
          
A:  
      the smallest element is selected from the unsorted array.
      then:  swapped with the leftmost element
      the swapped element becomes a part of the sorted-left of the array.    
    
Q: How does the algorithm resolve? :     

A:    
    the process of sorting the unsorted to the sorted-left continues until there is no unsorted-right

Q: What is the time-complexity of a selection sort? :    
A: O(n^2)
